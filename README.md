# FDAnalyzer

This project was developed as a class project for a Data Mining & Analysis Course at Texas A&M University and was developed in collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/ScottHoang"><strong>Scott Huang</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/sjray32"><strong>Samantha Ray</strong></a>. The idea was to visualize Adverse Drug Events collected from the <a href=https://open.fda.gov/data/faers>FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)</a> in an effort to facilitate easier understanding of adverse reactions that can occur from drug interactions. To visualize the data we used a <a href=https:\\www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/circularpacking_template.html>Circular Packing diagram</a>, where the size of the shown circles represents the number of events the drug has in common with the selected drug(s).
